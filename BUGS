- there are still some namespace issues. These should hopefully be
  resolved by libIDL 0.3-4 or so.

- if an parse error occurs, memory will be leaked--implement an
  allocator and do a non-recursive free if parse fails

- change lists to sorted heaps or hashes later if needed (low priority)

- do wide support string (?)
