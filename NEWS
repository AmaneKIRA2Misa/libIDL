Most needed features are working to read CORBA v2.2 IDL.  See the file
BUGS to see what else needs to be done; at this point things like
speed are low priority, however a changeover to using glib and more
efficient data structures like sorted heaps or hashes might be in
order down the line.  I'm not sure how useful libIDL might be apart
from its use in an IDL compiler, but the docs still need work.
