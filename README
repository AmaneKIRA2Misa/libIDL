Welcome to libIDL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

libIDL is a small library for creating parse trees of CORBA v2.2
compliant Interface Definition Language (IDL) files, which is a
specification for defining interfaces which can be used between
different CORBA implementations.  Although the primary use of libIDL
will be for a tool such as an IDL compiler, future uses may include
use in an interface repository or interface browsing tool.
